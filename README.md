# Political Party Affiliation Predictor Survey

## Overview
This program is a simple political survey Java application designed to predict a respondent's political party affiliation. It supports four political parties: Republican, Democrat, Independent, and Libertarian. The prediction is made based on the userâ€™s responses to a series of 10 questions, utilizing Bayes' theorem to calculate the likelihood of each party affiliation.

## How it Works
The program asks the user a series of 10 questions, each with four possible answers. Based on the user's responses, it calculates the likelihood of the user being affiliated with each of the four political parties. The party with the highest likelihood is then presented as the predicted party affiliation.

The likelihood calculations are based on a dataset of survey responses for each political party, stored in text files (`republicanResponses.txt`, `democratResponses.txt`, `independentResponses.txt`, `libertarianResponses.txt`). Each line in these files represents a set of responses to the survey questions.
